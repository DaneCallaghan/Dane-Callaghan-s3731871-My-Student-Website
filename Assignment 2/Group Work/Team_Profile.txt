Background: I want to have more knowledge with guidance, so then by these knowledge become's my wisdom to use in creation of global impact for global technological innovation. 
			This quite sound a big dreams but why not, as a human with a function as being human what makes me being me if my purpose is just for myself and not including everyone and surroundings. 
			I believe that I would not reach my purpose as the meaning of being human if i just do the regular thing as human do. 
			At this regularity of this mechanics, being just natural having no sense and defit its purpose, because why then I am exist in this space as other can be at my place then as naturally no meaning of my existence. 
			The purpose of being exist is what everyone to build as the freewill of your existence and take note that no one can built this for you, only but just you.

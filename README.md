## Education
Completed Year 10 at high school.  
Cert III in Electrotechnology.  
Cert IV in Electrical Equipment in Hazardous Areas.  
Completed 1st year of Bachelor of IT in 2009, then had to postpone.  
Diploma of Financial Planning.  
Currently studying a Bachelor of Business (Financial Planning).  

## Background:
I moved from highschool straight into my electrical apprenticeship. For around 20 years I worked in the electrical/construction industry in various working environments. I worked on basic residential dwellings all the way through to billion dollar mining projects.    
Mid 2017 I decided to commit fully to a career change. I put myself through a DFP, then progressed onto my current degree - Bbus (FP). I am currently working as an Associate Adviser for a financial planning firm.

## My Interest In IT
My earliest memories of "IT" are visiting the local Penny Arcade, which is the 1980's equivalent of Timezone. I was exposed to video games at a young age and became hooked. I got my first console at around 10 years old, which was the original Nintendo Entertainment System.  
I always seemed to have an interest in various technologies growing up, and was exposed to computing early as my mother taught computer literacy, database design and programming at Tafe.  
In 2009, I was dissatisfied with my job as an electrician and commenced at Bachelor of IT thruogh Griffith. I completed my first year then life circumstances got in the way and I postponed it with a view to complete at a later date. That was my first "real" deep exposure to what IT was. I loved it, and my results weren't bad considering I had no real actual experience previously.  

RMIT was chosen by default, although I am more than happy to be studying through them. My degree is offered online through them, although it's made up of many other university's modules too. The structure of my degree is that RMIT will issue it if I complete at least 8 core units through them.    

My expectations of this course are that I will receive a better overall understanding of what IT is, and how it applies to today's work environment. I am hoping it will help develop my IT knowledge, communication skills and help me identify ways in which IT can compliment my life.  

## Ideal Job

I have recently moved into the financial planning industry. Currently my ideal job is to be a financial adviser, with the hope of one day moving into a management or mentor type role. As such, the job posting below reflects my desire for that kind of position.

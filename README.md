I put myself through a DFP, then progressed onto my current degree - Bbus (FP). I am currently working as an Associate Adviser for a financial planning firm.

## My Interest In IT
My earliest memories of "IT" are visiting the local Penny Arcade, which is the 1980's equivalent of Timezone. I was exposed to video games at a young age and became hooked. I got my first console at around 10 years old, which was the original Nintendo Entertainment System.
